                      Working with June is awesome. In addition to planning and executing blog posts and marketing material, 
                      June has been a resource for me on several internal and client-facing projects. She code-switches between 
                      software documentation, sales-speak, and legal writing with ease and fluency, and has a knack for adjusting 
                      voice and tone to perfectly meet an audience. Combined with her deep understanding of software development 
                      processes, June is an asset for any team.

                      June has provided me with invaluable feedback on both content and style in my novels. She has a great attention 
                      for detail and a good eye for spotting discrepancies and inconsistencies. I can't recommend her highly enough.

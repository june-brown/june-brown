                          <p>Working with June is awesome. In addition to planning and executing blog posts and marketing 
                            material, June has been a resource for me on several internal and client-facing projects. She 
                            code-switches between software documentation, sales-speak, and legal writing with ease and fluency, 
                            and has a knack for adjusting voice and tone to perfectly meet an audience. Combined with her deep 
                            understanding of software development processes, June is an asset for any team.
